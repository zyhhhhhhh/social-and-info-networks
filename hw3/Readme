Girvan-Newman.py is the Girvan-Newman method. GN_approximate.py is the one using approximate betweenness. I used networkx to get the total edge number and node number. I asked on piazza and seems that is fine.

There are 3 input files starting from line9. Also a sample.txt, which is poorly created, because All the partitions are of size 1 except for a giant component that contains the rest.

Uncomment the testfile to use. Output will be printed on the console. Time is recorded for both, and it will also show on the console.

I have attached result in Output1, Output2 and Output3 both docx and pdf.
